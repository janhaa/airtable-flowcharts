## Renaming and Configuring the `env.js` File

To properly configure your application, follow these steps to rename the `env.example.js` file to `env.js` and replace the placeholder values with the provided values:

1. Locate the `env.example.js` file in your project directory.
2. Rename the file from `env.example.js` to `env.js`.
3. Open the `env.js` file using a text editor.

Inside the `env.js` file, you will find the following lines:

```javascript
const app = "<APP_ID>"; // Replace with your app ID
const table = "<TABLE_NAME>"; // Replace with the name of your table
const api_key = "<API_KEY>"; // Replace with your API key
const linkField = "<LINK_FIELD>"; // Replace with the name of the link field
```

Replace the placeholder values with the corresponding values for your application:

<APP_ID>: Replace this with your actual app ID.

<TABLE_NAME>: Replace this with the name of the table you are working with in your app.

<API_KEY>: Replace this with your API key.

<LINK_FIELD>: Replace this with the name of the link field you want to use in your application.

Once you have replaced the placeholder values, save the env.js file.

By following these steps, you have successfully renamed the env.example.js file to env.js and updated the variable values within the file. These values will be used by your application to connect to the correct app, table, and API key, allowing your application to function properly.
